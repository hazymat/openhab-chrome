# Files for updating Chrome Web Store
- "openhab-chrome.zip" is the file to be used on Chrome Web Store when updating.
- At "screenshot-source" there's a GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/) file that can be used to frame new screenshots and apply the "openHAB Controller for Chrome" extension logo when needed.
- Original screenshot crops that were used on the already framed ones should be kept there for future usage.
